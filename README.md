# SAM reader

Used to extract simple data from a .sam file.

## Description

A Python script that extracts simple data from a .sam file. It needs a .sam file (see [samformat.info](https://www.samformat.info/) for more info) in parameter. When running the script, it will ask the user to input a certain threshold for filtering reads with a certain mapping quality. It will generate a .txt file that sums up simple data.

Input:
* a single .sam file

Output:
* a .txt file containing:
    * the total number of reads
    * the number of different reads
    * the number of paired reads
    * the number of reads mapped in proper pair
    * the number of reads matched at 100% (CIGAR)
    * The number of reads with a mapping quality higher than a certain threshold (threshold can be set manually)
